\section{How to improve the labwork} \newline

The processing of the image is done with a grid of thread blocks, while in the previous labwork, a one dimension array of blocks was used to do the processing.

\section{Tests with different sizes of blocks} \newline

\textbf{With Dimension (32 x 32) :} \newline 

Time of execution = 165,12 (average out of 5 tests) \newline

\textbf{With Dimension (16 x 16) :} \newline 

Time of execution = 166,06 ms (average out of 5 tests) \newline

We conclude there is no considerable change in time of execution when the block size is modified. \newline
